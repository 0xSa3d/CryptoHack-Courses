# CryptoHack — Learning Repository

This repository documents my structured progress while studying cryptography through the CryptoHack platform.  
It contains concise notes and Python-based solutions for each challenge, organized by module.

## Purpose

- Build strong fundamentals in practical cryptography
- Develop byte-level data handling skills
- Practice systematic cryptanalysis techniques used in CTF environments

## Modules

- **Introduction** — Encoding, bytes manipulation, XOR fundamentals
- **Modular Arithmetic** — Number theory basics used in public-key cryptography (in progress)
- **Public-Key Cryptography** — Planned
- **Symmetric Cryptography** — Planned
- **Elliptic Curves** — Planned

## Repository Structure

Each module directory contains:

- `NOTES.md` — Consolidated technical notes for the module
- One subdirectory per challenge:
  - `solve.py` — Implementation used to solve the task
  - `README.md` — Brief explanation of the approach and concept

## Progress Tracking

See `PROGRESS.md` for completion status across modules.

## Scope and Policy

- Flags are intentionally omitted.
- Focus is on methodology, data representation, and reasoning rather than tooling.
