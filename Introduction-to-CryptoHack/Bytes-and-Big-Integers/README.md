## Bytes and Big Integers

### Category
Introduction — Mathematics / Data Representation

### Challenge Summary
Public key cryptosystems such as RSA operate on large integers, while real-world messages are composed of characters.  
This challenge demonstrates how messages can be transformed between byte sequences and large integer representations.

### Approach
- Understand that a text message can be expressed as a sequence of ASCII bytes.
- Recognize that concatenated byte values can be interpreted as a hexadecimal number.
- Convert the provided large integer back into its original byte representation.
- Interpret the resulting bytes as readable text.

### Key Concept
Modern cryptographic algorithms frequently operate on numerical forms of data.  
Being able to convert between characters, bytes, hexadecimal, and big integers is essential for implementing and analyzing public key cryptographic processes.
