## ASCII

### Category
Introduction — Encoding

### Challenge Summary
ASCII is a 7-bit encoding standard that represents characters using integer values between 0 and 127.  
The challenge provides a sequence of integers that must be translated into their corresponding characters to recover the original text.

### Approach
- Recognize that the given values represent ASCII ordinal numbers.
- Convert each integer into its associated character.
- Reconstruct the message by processing the sequence in order.

### Key Concept
Understanding how text is represented as numeric values is a foundational skill when handling encoded data and preparing for later cryptographic analysis tasks.
